# 1. Decision to Use OpenAPI and Swagger for API Documentation

## Status

**Accepted**

## Context

As this project involves developing a REST API, clear and comprehensive documentation is essential for ensuring usability by both internal and external developers. The documentation must:
- **Define API Behavior**: Provide a detailed specification of endpoints, request/response structures, and expected behaviors.
- **Support Automation**: Enable automated client generation, validation, and testing workflows.
- **Be Easy to Maintain**: Update seamlessly as the API evolves.
- **Be Developer-Friendly**: Offer an interactive interface for exploring and testing endpoints.

After evaluating multiple options, OpenAPI (formerly Swagger Specification) was chosen as the standard for API documentation, with Swagger UI providing an interactive frontend.

## Decision

The project will use **OpenAPI** as the standard for documenting the API and **Swagger UI** for hosting the documentation.

### OpenAPI
- **Specification**: All API endpoints will be documented using the OpenAPI specification (current version: 3.0+).
- **Location**: The OpenAPI spec will be stored in the repository under the `doc/` directory as `openapi.yaml` for easy version control and maintenance.

### Swagger UI
- **Interactive Documentation**: Swagger UI will be configured to display the OpenAPI documentation, enabling developers to explore and test the API in a browser.
- **Hosting**: Swagger UI will be hosted via GitHub Pages, ensuring accessibility for both internal and external stakeholders.
- **Automation**: The Swagger UI will be updated automatically when the OpenAPI spec is modified, ensuring consistency.

## Consequences

### Benefits
- **Standardization**: OpenAPI is an industry-standard specification, ensuring compatibility with tools for client generation, testing, and monitoring.
- **Interactive Documentation**: Swagger UI offers an intuitive interface for developers to interact with the API, improving the developer experience.
- **Automation**: Tools like Postman, jOOQ, and code generators can consume OpenAPI specs to automate workflows.
- **Improved Collaboration**: A clear API spec fosters collaboration by providing developers and stakeholders with a single source of truth.
- **Ease of Maintenance**: The OpenAPI spec and Swagger UI are straightforward to maintain, reducing documentation drift.
- **Testing Support**: Swaggerâ€™s support for mock servers and validation makes it easier to test API behavior early in the development cycle.

### Drawbacks
- **Learning Curve**: Developers unfamiliar with OpenAPI may need time to understand and use the specification effectively.
- **Initial Setup Effort**: Configuring Swagger UI and hosting it on GitHub Pages requires initial setup effort.
- **Dependency**: Relying on OpenAPI and Swagger means introducing additional tools into the development workflow, which may require monitoring for compatibility with updates.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Postman Collections**: Rejected because Postman collections are excellent for API testing but lack the standardization and tooling ecosystem of OpenAPI.
- **Manually Written Documentation**: Rejected due to its high maintenance overhead and susceptibility to inconsistencies as the API evolves.

## Conclusion

By adopting OpenAPI and Swagger UI, the project benefits from industry-standard documentation practices, improving developer experience and collaboration while enabling automation and testing workflows. The decision aligns with the project's goals of scalability, usability, and maintainability.
