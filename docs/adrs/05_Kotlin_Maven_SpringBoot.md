# 5. Decision to Use Kotlin, Maven, and Spring Boot for Application Development

## Status

**Accepted**

## Context

The project requires a robust and modern technology stack for building a scalable and maintainable REST API. The key goals include:
- **Developer Productivity**: A language and framework that supports concise, expressive, and maintainable code.
- **Ecosystem Support**: Leveraging a mature ecosystem with libraries, tools, and community support.
- **Build Management**: A reliable and flexible tool for managing dependencies, builds, and project lifecycle.
- **Rapid Development**: Framework support for building REST APIs quickly while maintaining flexibility and extensibility.

After evaluating multiple options, Kotlin, Maven, and Spring Boot were chosen for the following reasons.

## Decision

### **Kotlin**
- A modern, statically typed programming language designed to increase developer productivity and code safety.
- Provides excellent interoperability with Java, allowing seamless integration with the Java ecosystem.
- Features like null safety, extension functions, and a concise syntax reduce boilerplate code and common programming errors.

### **Maven**
- A widely-used build automation and dependency management tool.
- Ensures consistency across builds and integrates well with Kotlin and Spring Boot.
- Supports a robust plugin ecosystem for tasks like code generation (e.g., jOOQ), testing, and deployment.

### **Spring Boot**
- A feature-rich framework for building enterprise-grade REST APIs with minimal configuration.
- Provides powerful abstractions for dependency injection, request routing, and database interaction.
- Simplifies integration with tools like Flyway for database migrations and Swagger for API documentation.
- Offers production-ready features like metrics, health checks, and logging out of the box.

## Consequences

### Benefits
- **Developer Productivity**:
    - Kotlin's concise syntax and safety features reduce development time and improve code quality.
    - Spring Boot's opinionated defaults and extensive tooling streamline REST API development.
- **Interoperability**:
    - Kotlin’s full compatibility with Java allows leveraging existing Java libraries and tools.
    - Maven's wide adoption ensures compatibility with most tools and frameworks.
- **Scalability**:
    - Spring Boot’s modularity supports scaling the application as requirements grow.
    - Maven’s dependency management simplifies maintaining and upgrading libraries.
- **Community and Ecosystem**:
    - Kotlin and Spring Boot benefit from active communities, ensuring access to best practices, documentation, and support.
    - Maven’s mature ecosystem provides plugins and integrations for nearly every development need.

### Drawbacks
- **Learning Curve**:
    - Developers unfamiliar with Kotlin or Spring Boot may require time to get up to speed.
- **Opinionated Defaults**:
    - Spring Boot’s opinionated configuration might require customization to deviate from default behaviors.
- **Build Speed**:
    - Maven's build times can be slower compared to some alternative tools like Gradle, especially in larger projects.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Java with Spring Boot**:
    - Rejected because Kotlin offers additional productivity and safety features over Java while maintaining interoperability.
2. **Gradle**:
    - Rejected in favor of Maven due to Maven’s simpler configuration and the team’s familiarity with it.
3. **Micronaut**:
    - Rejected due to the smaller community and ecosystem compared to Spring Boot, despite its faster startup times and lower memory footprint.

## Conclusion

Using Kotlin, Maven, and Spring Boot aligns with the project's goals of scalability, developer productivity, and ecosystem maturity. This stack provides a modern, efficient, and maintainable foundation for building the REST API while leveraging established tools and frameworks.
