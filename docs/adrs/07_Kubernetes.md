# 7. Decision to Use Kubernetes for Container Orchestration

## Status

**Accepted**

## Context

The project requires a scalable and reliable solution for deploying and managing the application in production and test environments. Key requirements include:
- **Scalability**: Automatically scale the application to handle varying traffic loads.
- **Reliability**: Ensure high availability of services with minimal downtime.
- **Portability**: Deploy consistently across different cloud providers or on-premises environments.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimize resource usage by dynamically allocating resources to containers.
- **Automation**: Streamline deployment, scaling, and management of containers.

After evaluating multiple container orchestration platforms, Kubernetes (K8s) was chosen for its comprehensive feature set, active ecosystem, and ability to meet the project’s operational needs.

## Decision

The project will use **Kubernetes** for container orchestration to deploy and manage the application.

### Kubernetes Features
- **Declarative Configuration**: Infrastructure is defined as code through YAML manifests, enabling reproducible deployments.
- **Automated Scaling**: Horizontal Pod Autoscalers adjust the number of running pods based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics.
- **Self-Healing**: Kubernetes automatically restarts failed containers and reschedules pods on healthy nodes.
- **Load Balancing**: Built-in service discovery and load balancing distribute traffic across healthy instances of the application.
- **Rolling Updates**: Seamless application updates minimize downtime by rolling out changes incrementally.
- **Namespace Isolation**: Support for namespaces enables logical separation of environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
- **Ecosystem Integration**: Compatible with CI/CD tools, monitoring systems (e.g., Prometheus), and service meshes (e.g., Istio).

## Consequences

### Benefits
- **Scalability**: Kubernetes dynamically adjusts resources to handle fluctuating workloads.
- **High Availability**: Ensures application reliability with built-in self-healing and failover capabilities.
- **Flexibility**: Supports hybrid and multi-cloud deployments, offering flexibility in choosing cloud providers.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Declarative manifests ensure consistency and traceability of infrastructure changes.
- **Ecosystem Support**: Kubernetes has a large ecosystem of tools and active community support, ensuring long-term viability and innovation.
- **Automation**: Automates deployments, scaling, and resource allocation, reducing operational overhead.

### Drawbacks
- **Learning Curve**: Kubernetes has a steep learning curve for developers and operators unfamiliar with container orchestration.
- **Resource Requirements**: Running a Kubernetes cluster requires additional infrastructure and computing resources.
- **Complexity**: Managing Kubernetes clusters and configurations can introduce operational complexity.
- **Initial Setup Effort**: Setting up Kubernetes, including cluster provisioning and configuring CI/CD pipelines, requires significant effort.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Docker Swarm**:
    - Rejected due to its limited feature set compared to Kubernetes and smaller community support.
2. **AWS ECS**:
    - Rejected because it is tied to the AWS ecosystem, reducing portability to other cloud providers.
3. **Nomad**:
    - Rejected due to a smaller ecosystem and community compared to Kubernetes, despite its simplicity.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Cluster Setup**: Use a managed Kubernetes service (e.g., AWS EKS, Google GKE, or Azure AKS) to simplify cluster provisioning and management.
2. **Containerization**: Ensure all application components are containerized using Docker.
3. **Deployment**: Define Kubernetes manifests for deployment, services, and other resources.
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Update the CI/CD pipeline to deploy applications to Kubernetes clusters automatically.
5. **Monitoring and Logging**: Integrate with tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack for monitoring and logging.

## Conclusion

Kubernetes provides a scalable, reliable, and portable solution for deploying and managing the application. While it introduces a learning curve and operational complexity, its benefits in automation, high availability, and ecosystem support align with the project’s long-term goals. This decision ensures the infrastructure is capable of supporting future growth and evolving requirements.
