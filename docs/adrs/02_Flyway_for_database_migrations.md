# 2. Decision to Use Flyway for Database Migrations

## Status

**Accepted**

## Context

Managing database schema changes in a consistent and reliable manner is crucial for the success of this project. Without a standardized approach, maintaining version control for the database schema could lead to discrepancies, making deployments and rollbacks difficult and error-prone.

Flyway is a widely-used database migration tool that integrates seamlessly with a variety of relational databases, including PostgreSQL, which is the database for this project. Its version-controlled migration files offer a straightforward mechanism for tracking schema changes and applying them across environments.

## Decision

This project will use **Flyway** to manage database migrations.

## Consequences

- **Version Control for Database Schema**: Schema changes will be tracked in a versioned format, enabling better management and visibility of database modifications.
- **Consistency Across Environments**: Flyway ensures that schema changes are applied uniformly across all environments (development, testing, production), reducing the likelihood of environment-specific issues.
- **Rollback Capability**: Flyway supports controlled rollbacks of database changes, allowing for safer deployment processes and easier recovery from errors.
- **Seamless Integration**: Flyway's compatibility with Maven and Spring Boot simplifies integration into the projectâ€™s existing toolchain.
- **Reduced Human Error**: Automated migration processes minimize the risks associated with manual schema updates.
- **Transparent History**: Flyway's migration history provides a clear record of changes, supporting debugging and audits.

By choosing Flyway, the project adopts a proven solution that enhances database management, supports agile development practices, and aligns with the project's priorities for reliability and maintainability.
