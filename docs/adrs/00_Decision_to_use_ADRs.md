# 0. Decision to Use Architectural Design Records

## Status

**Accepted**

## Context

Michael Nygard introduced a valuable template for documenting architectural decisions as a running list of Markdown files. This project adopts that practice to ensure a systematic approach to recording key architectural choices. Documenting the decision to use ADRs also acknowledges the importance of this methodology and pays homage to its creator.

## Decision

This project will use Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) to document architectural decisions consistently.

## Consequences

- **Centralized Documentation**: Architectural decisions will be well-documented in a single, accessible location.
- **Historical Context**: Developers and stakeholders can reference the rationale behind specific decisions, providing clarity on the project's evolution.
- **Improved Transparency**: The documentation will highlight the reasoning behind selected technologies, design patterns, schemas, and other decisions, emphasizing how they align with user, client, and developer priorities (in that order).

By maintaining this practice, the project fosters a culture of thoughtful decision-making and accountability.
