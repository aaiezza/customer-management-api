# Decision to Deploy the Service to an Accessible Environment via CI/CD

## Status

**Proposed**

## Context

The current CI/CD pipeline automates the process of building and testing the application. However, the service is not deployed to an accessible environment where it can be consumed by clients or stakeholders. Deploying the service as part of the CI/CD process ensures that it is readily available for:

1. **Development Testing**: Developers can interact with the live service to test integration scenarios.
2. **Stakeholder Validation**: Stakeholders can verify the application functionality in a staging or production-like environment.
3. **User Access**: Clients or end-users can consume the service in production.

Deploying the service to an accessible environment provides a clear and consistent process for releasing updates and maintaining availability.

## Decision

The CI/CD pipeline will include a deployment stage that deploys the service to an accessible environment. This deployment will target specific environments, such as:

1. **Development**: For internal testing and iteration.
2. **Staging**: For stakeholder review and pre-production testing.
3. **Production**: For end-user access.

### Deployment Options

#### 1. **AWS**
- Deploy the service to **Elastic Beanstalk**, **ECS**, or **EKS**.
- Use a public-facing load balancer to make the service accessible.
- Example:
    - Build the application in CI/CD.
    - Publish a Docker image to **Amazon ECR**.
    - Deploy the image to ECS using Fargate.

#### 2. **Azure**
- Deploy the service to **Azure App Service** or **AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)**.
- Use Azure DNS to expose the service to clients.
- Example:
    - Push the service artifacts to Azure.
    - Use an Azure DevOps pipeline to deploy the service.

#### 3. **Self-Hosted**
- Use tools like **Ansible**, **Terraform**, or **Kubernetes** to deploy to self-hosted servers.
- Example:
    - Jenkins pipeline builds and pushes the service to a private registry.
    - Deploy the service to a self-hosted Kubernetes cluster.

#### 4. **GitHub Actions**
- Define a deployment workflow in GitHub Actions.
- Deploy to a cloud provider or a self-hosted environment using tools like `kubectl` or Terraform.

### Example Deployment Workflow

1. **Build and Test**: Ensure the application passes all automated tests.
2. **Artifact Packaging**: Package the application as a JAR, WAR, or Docker image.
3. **Deploy**:
    - Use environment-specific configurations for deployment.
    - Expose the service via DNS or a public IP.
4. **Post-Deployment Verification**: Run smoke tests or health checks to confirm the service is functioning as expected.

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Accessibility**: Ensures the service is available for clients, stakeholders, and end-users.
- **Consistent Deployment**: Automates and standardizes the process of releasing updates.
- **Rapid Feedback**: Provides stakeholders and users with access to the latest changes for faster validation.
- **Scalability**: Simplifies scaling to multiple environments (e.g., staging, production).

### Drawbacks

- **Initial Complexity**: Setting up deployment pipelines and environments requires effort.
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Environments and deployment configurations need to be maintained over time.
- **Cost**: Hosting environments, especially in the cloud, incur costs.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Manual Deployment**:
    - Rejected because it is time-consuming and prone to errors.

2. **Local-Only Testing**:
    - Rejected because it limits accessibility and stakeholder validation.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Environment Setup**:
    - Configure environments (e.g., AWS, Azure, or self-hosted) to host the service.

2. **CI/CD Pipeline Updates**:
    - Add deployment stages to the existing CI/CD pipeline.
    - Use tools like Terraform, Helm, or cloud-specific SDKs for automation.

3. **Testing and Verification**:
    - Implement smoke tests and health checks for deployed services.

4. **Documentation**:
    - Document the deployment process and access endpoints for each environment.

## Conclusion

Deploying the service to an accessible environment as part of the CI/CD pipeline improves usability, accessibility, and consistency. While it introduces initial complexity and costs, the long-term benefits of a reliable and scalable deployment process outweigh the drawbacks.
