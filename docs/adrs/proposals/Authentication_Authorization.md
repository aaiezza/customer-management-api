# Decision to Enforce Authentication and Authorization for Sensitive Endpoints

## Status

**Proposed**

## Context

The Customer Management API potentially handles Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as customer names, email addresses, and phone numbers. Protecting this sensitive data is critical to ensure compliance with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and to maintain user trust.

Without authentication and authorization mechanisms, the API would be vulnerable to unauthorized access, exposing sensitive data to potential misuse or breaches. Securing sensitive endpoints ensures that only authorized clients and users can access or modify protected resources.

## Decision

The API will enforce a layer of security that ensures:

1. **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of the requester.
2. **Authorization**: Validates the requesterâ€™s permissions to access a given resource or perform an operation.

This decision applies to all sensitive endpoints that handle or expose PII or critical functionality.

### Implementation Details

1. **Authentication**:
    - Use industry-standard mechanisms such as **OAuth 2.0**, **OpenID Connect**, or **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens) for token-based authentication.
    - Require valid authentication tokens in the `Authorization` header for all requests to sensitive endpoints.

2. **Authorization**:
    - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to define and enforce user permissions (e.g., `admin`, `user`, `support` roles).
    - Define granular permissions for each endpoint or resource.

3. **Sensitive Endpoints**:
    - Examples of endpoints requiring protection:
        - `POST /customers` (create a new customer)
        - `GET /customers/{id}` (view customer details)
        - `PUT /customers/{id}` (update customer details)
        - `DELETE /customers/{id}` (delete customer record)

4. **Logging and Monitoring**:
    - Log authentication and authorization events (e.g., failed attempts) for auditing and anomaly detection.
    - Integrate with monitoring tools to detect and respond to potential security threats in real time.

5. **Security Best Practices**:
    - Use HTTPS to encrypt all data in transit.
    - Rotate and revoke access tokens when necessary.
    - Implement rate limiting to mitigate brute force attacks.
    - Conduct periodic security audits and penetration testing.

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Enhanced Security**: Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data and operations.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensures adherence to data protection laws like GDPR and CCPA.
- **Improved Trust**: Demonstrates a commitment to safeguarding user data, enhancing client and user trust.
- **Auditing**: Facilitates traceability and accountability by logging access and actions.

### Drawbacks

- **Increased Complexity**: Adds overhead to the implementation and maintenance of the API.
- **Performance Impact**: Authentication and authorization checks introduce slight latency for requests.
- **Client Development**: Requires clients consuming the API to implement authentication mechanisms.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **No Authentication or Authorization**:
    - Rejected because it leaves sensitive data unprotected and increases the risk of data breaches.

2. **Basic Authentication**:
    - Rejected because it lacks robustness and does not scale well for modern applications.

3. **API Key-Based Access**:
    - Considered for simplicity but rejected because it does not provide fine-grained control over resource access or user-specific permissions.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Authentication Framework**:
    - Integrate Spring Security to handle authentication and token validation.
    - Use JWTs for stateless authentication and integrate with an OAuth 2.0 provider if needed.

2. **Role-Based Access Control**:
    - Define roles and permissions for all sensitive endpoints.
    - Implement access checks in service and controller layers.

3. **Documentation**:
    - Update the API documentation to specify authentication requirements for each endpoint.

4. **Testing**:
    - Write unit and integration tests to validate authentication and authorization logic.
    - Perform manual testing to verify behavior under different scenarios.

5. **Deployment**:
    - Roll out security features incrementally, starting with authentication and then adding fine-grained authorization rules.

## Conclusion

Enforcing authentication and authorization for sensitive endpoints is essential for protecting user data, ensuring regulatory compliance, and fostering trust. While it introduces complexity, the benefits of enhanced security and data protection far outweigh the drawbacks. This decision aligns with best practices for building secure and reliable APIs.
