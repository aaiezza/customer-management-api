# Decision to Adopt AWS Serverless Architecture

## Status

**Proposed**

## Context

A serverless architecture leverages cloud-native managed services to minimize operational overhead, improve scalability, and reduce costs. AWS provides a comprehensive ecosystem for serverless applications through services like **API Gateway**, **AWS Lambda**, and **Amazon RDS**. By adopting a serverless architecture, the API can:

1. **Scalability**: Automatically scale based on demand without manual intervention.
2. **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for the compute resources and services used.
3. **Reduced Operational Overhead**: Eliminate the need to manage servers and infrastructure.

This architecture is well-suited for scenarios with unpredictable or spiky traffic patterns and where rapid iteration and deployment are priorities.

## Decision

The API will adopt an AWS serverless architecture using the following components:

1. **Amazon API Gateway**:
    - Provides a managed entry point for API requests.
    - Handles routing, throttling, and monitoring.

2. **AWS Lambda**:
    - Executes business logic in stateless, event-driven functions.
    - Automatically scales with demand.

3. **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)**:
    - Stores persistent data in a managed relational database.
    - Offers automated backups, scaling, and high availability.

### Architecture Overview

#### Request Workflow:

1. **Client Request**: A client sends an HTTP request to the API Gateway.
2. **API Gateway**:
    - Routes the request to the appropriate Lambda function.
    - Performs input validation, throttling, and caching.
3. **Lambda Execution**:
    - The Lambda function executes the business logic.
    - Queries or updates the Amazon RDS database as needed.
4. **Response**:
    - The Lambda function returns the response to the API Gateway, which forwards it to the client.

### Example Configuration

#### API Gateway:
- Define REST or HTTP APIs.
- Configure stages (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `prod`) for deployment.

#### AWS Lambda:
- Deploy functions for different API endpoints (e.g., `getCustomer`, `createCustomer`).
- Use AWS SDKs to connect to RDS for data operations.

#### Amazon RDS:
- Use **Amazon Aurora Serverless** for a fully serverless database option.
- Define database schemas and connection pooling strategies.

### Example Request Flow

1. **GET /customers**:
    - API Gateway routes the request to the `getCustomers` Lambda function.
    - The Lambda function queries the RDS database and returns a list of customers.

2. **POST /customers**:
    - API Gateway routes the request to the `createCustomer` Lambda function.
    - The Lambda function inserts a new customer record into the RDS database and returns a confirmation.

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Scalability**: Automatically handles varying traffic levels without manual provisioning.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay-as-you-go pricing model reduces costs during low usage periods.
- **Reduced Management**: AWS handles infrastructure provisioning, scaling, and maintenance.
- **High Availability**: Managed services like API Gateway and RDS provide built-in fault tolerance and availability.

### Drawbacks

- **Cold Start Latency**: Lambda functions may experience delays during initialization.
- **Complexity in Debugging**: Distributed architecture can make debugging and tracing issues more complex.
- **Vendor Lock-In**: Tight integration with AWS services may make it difficult to migrate to other platforms.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Traditional Server-Based Architecture**:
    - Rejected because it requires significant operational overhead and does not scale as efficiently.

2. **Container-Based Architecture**:
    - Considered using ECS or EKS, but rejected for this use case due to higher management complexity compared to serverless.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Set Up API Gateway**:
    - Create APIs and configure endpoints.
    - Define request/response models and validation rules.

2. **Develop Lambda Functions**:
    - Write functions for each endpoint.
    - Use the AWS SDK for database operations.

3. **Provision Amazon RDS**:
    - Create and configure the database.
    - Define schemas and connect Lambda functions to the database.

4. **Monitoring and Logging**:
    - Enable AWS CloudWatch for monitoring API Gateway, Lambda, and RDS metrics.
    - Implement distributed tracing with AWS X-Ray.

5. **Testing**:
    - Validate end-to-end functionality in development and staging environments.
    - Simulate high traffic to test scalability and performance.

6. **Deployment**:
    - Use AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) or CloudFormation templates for infrastructure as code.
    - Automate deployments with CI/CD pipelines.

## Conclusion

Adopting an AWS serverless architecture enables the API to scale effortlessly, reduce operational overhead, and achieve cost efficiency. While there are trade-offs, such as cold start latency and potential vendor lock-in, the benefits align with the projectâ€™s goals of flexibility, scalability, and rapid development.
