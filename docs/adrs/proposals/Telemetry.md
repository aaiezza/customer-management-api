# Decision to Add Telemetry for Observability

## Status

**Proposed**

## Context

To meet the project's observability goals, telemetry is necessary to monitor and understand the applicationâ€™s behavior in real time. This includes insights into performance, errors, and usage patterns.

This project already uses "first-class" log event classes, and json formatted events for the purposes of standardization.

## Decision

The project will implement telemetry using the following:
- **Micrometer**: For application metrics exported in Prometheus format.
- **OpenTelemetry**: For distributed tracing and request flow visualization.
- **Structured Logging**: Enhanced logs with trace IDs and JSON formatting.

## Consequences

### Benefits

- Improved application visibility and debugging.
- Easier monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana integration.
- Demonstrates modern observability practices in line with industry standards.

### Drawbacks

- Additional configuration and potential performance overhead for metrics and tracing.
