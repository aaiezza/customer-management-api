# Decision to Add Telemetry for Observability

## Status

**Proposed**

## Context

To meet the project's observability goals, telemetry is necessary to monitor and understand the application’s behavior in real time. This includes insights into performance, errors, and usage patterns.

This project already uses "first-class" log event classes and JSON-formatted events for the purposes of standardization.

## Decision

The project will implement telemetry using one or more of the following solutions:

1. **Micrometer**:
    - For application metrics exported in Prometheus format.

2. **OpenTelemetry**:
    - For distributed tracing and request flow visualization.

3. **Structured Logging**:
    - Enhanced logs with trace IDs and JSON formatting.

4. **New Relic**:
    - A commercial observability platform offering full-stack monitoring, distributed tracing, and anomaly detection.

5. **DataDog**:
    - A comprehensive monitoring and analytics platform with features like APM (Application Performance Monitoring), infrastructure monitoring, and integrated logs.

6. **Loggly**:
    - A logging and log management service providing centralized log aggregation and analysis.

## Consequences

### Benefits

- Improved application visibility and debugging.
- Easier monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana integration.
- Demonstrates modern observability practices in line with industry standards.
- Broad flexibility with a variety of tools for tailored observability solutions.

### Drawbacks

- Additional configuration and potential performance overhead for metrics and tracing.
- Commercial tools like New Relic, DataDog, and Loggly may incur significant costs.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Basic Logging Only**:
    - Rejected because it lacks the depth and real-time capabilities of full telemetry solutions.

2. **Periodic Manual Monitoring**:
    - Rejected because it is reactive and labor-intensive, leading to slower issue resolution.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Evaluate Options**:
    - Assess project needs and choose the most suitable telemetry solutions.

2. **Integration**:
    - Implement selected solutions for metrics, logs, and traces.

3. **Testing**:
    - Validate the telemetry setup in a staging environment.

4. **Documentation**:
    - Document the implementation details, usage, and troubleshooting steps.

## Conclusion

Adding telemetry to the project ensures improved observability and operational insight. The flexibility to choose among tools like Micrometer, OpenTelemetry, New Relic, DataDog, and Loggly provides robust solutions for performance monitoring, debugging, and usage analysis. While introducing some cost and complexity, these benefits align with the project’s observability goals.
