# 4. Decision to Use jOOQ for Database Interactions

## Status

**Accepted**

## Context

The project requires a robust approach to interact with the PostgreSQL database. The goals for database interactions include:
- **Type Safety**: Reducing runtime errors by leveraging compile-time validation for SQL queries.
- **SQL Control**: Writing and executing complex, custom SQL queries with full control and flexibility.
- **Maintainability**: Simplifying the mapping between relational database structures and application objects without introducing heavy frameworks.
- **Performance**: Efficient query execution with minimal abstraction overhead.

Several options were considered for database interaction:
1. **Spring Data JPA**: While it provides abstraction for database operations, its reliance on Hibernate and the complexity of managing object-relational mapping (ORM) were deemed unnecessary for this project.
2. **Raw SQL**: Offers full control but lacks type safety and requires manual management of result sets and query construction.
3. **jOOQ**: A lightweight, type-safe library that generates Java code from database schemas and provides full control over SQL queries while ensuring type safety and maintainability.

After evaluating these options, jOOQ was selected as the best fit for this project.

## Decision

The project will use **jOOQ** as the primary library for database interactions. This decision is based on the following features and advantages:
- **Type-Safe SQL**: jOOQ generates classes and methods from the database schema, ensuring compile-time validation of SQL queries.
- **SQL-First Approach**: Developers can write SQL queries directly while benefiting from Java's type system, providing full control over database operations.
- **Schema Synchronization**: jOOQ automatically generates Java code that reflects the database schema, reducing mismatches between the database and application code.
- **Integration with PostgreSQL**: jOOQ offers native support for PostgreSQL-specific features, such as JSON, JSONB, and advanced SQL functions.
- **No ORM Overhead**: Unlike traditional ORMs, jOOQ eliminates the need for complex object-relational mapping, focusing on SQL execution and results.

## Consequences

### Benefits
- **Enhanced Type Safety**: jOOQ ensures compile-time validation of SQL queries, reducing runtime errors and improving code reliability.
- **Full SQL Control**: Developers can write and optimize SQL queries directly, leveraging the full power of PostgreSQL features.
- **Simplified Code Maintenance**: Schema-generated code keeps application code in sync with the database, reducing the risk of errors caused by schema changes.
- **Improved Developer Productivity**: jOOQ's fluent API simplifies query construction while maintaining readability and expressiveness.
- **Seamless Integration**: jOOQ integrates well with the project's existing tech stack, including Kotlin and Spring Boot.

### Drawbacks
- **Learning Curve**: Developers unfamiliar with jOOQ may require time to learn its API and features.
- **Generated Code Size**: Schema generation may result in a large number of classes, which can increase build times and complexity in larger databases.
- **SQL Knowledge Requirement**: Unlike ORMs, jOOQ requires developers to have a solid understanding of SQL to use it effectively.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Spring Data JPA**: Rejected due to its abstraction overhead, reliance on Hibernate, and lack of support for fine-tuned SQL queries.
- **Raw SQL**: Rejected due to the lack of type safety and the manual effort required to manage query construction and result sets.
- **MyBatis**: Rejected as it provides flexibility for SQL but lacks the type safety and schema synchronization features of jOOQ.

## Conclusion

jOOQ aligns with the project's goals of maintainability, type safety, and full SQL control, making it an ideal choice for database interactions. While it introduces a slight learning curve, its benefits in productivity, flexibility, and reliability outweigh the drawbacks. The project will adopt jOOQ for database operations, leveraging its powerful integration with PostgreSQL to build a robust and scalable application.
