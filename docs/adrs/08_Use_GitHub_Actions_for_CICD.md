# 8. Decision to Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Status

**Accepted**

## Context

The project requires a robust and flexible solution for implementing Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD). The CI/CD pipeline must:
- **Automate Workflows**: Build, test, and deploy the application efficiently.
- **Support Integration**: Work seamlessly with the project’s version control system and external tools (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).
- **Be Scalable and Maintainable**: Handle growing project requirements while being easy to manage.
- **Ensure Accessibility**: Provide clear feedback to developers for every commit, pull request, and deployment.

After evaluating multiple CI/CD platforms, GitHub Actions was chosen for its tight integration with GitHub, simplicity, and extensive ecosystem.

## Decision

The project will use **GitHub Actions** as the CI/CD platform for automating builds, tests, and deployments.

### GitHub Actions Features

- **Workflow Automation**: YAML-based workflows define automation tasks triggered by events such as pushes, pull requests, and scheduled jobs.
- **Tight Integration**: Built directly into GitHub, enabling seamless integration with repositories, pull requests, and GitHub Packages.
- **Extensible Ecosystem**: Thousands of reusable actions are available for common tasks (e.g., running tests, building Docker images, deploying to Kubernetes).
- **Scalability**: Scales to meet project demands with GitHub-hosted runners or self-hosted runners.
- **Secrets Management**: Built-in support for securely storing and accessing sensitive data like API keys and credentials.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Displays build and deployment status directly in pull requests and commits.

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Developer Productivity**: Developers receive immediate feedback on code changes through automated builds and tests.
- **Ease of Use**: GitHub Actions’ native integration with GitHub simplifies setup and management.
- **Cost-Effective**: Free tier provides ample resources for small-to-medium projects, with flexible scaling for larger needs.
- **Customizable Workflows**: YAML configuration files allow tailored workflows to meet project-specific CI/CD requirements.
- **Extensive Ecosystem**: Reusable actions reduce the need to write custom scripts for common tasks.
- **Centralized Management**: CI/CD is managed directly within the GitHub repository, reducing context switching and simplifying operations.

### Drawbacks

- **Limited Vendor Portability**: Tightly coupled with GitHub; migrating to another CI/CD platform would require significant effort.
- **Complex Workflows**: Highly complex pipelines may become harder to manage in YAML.
- **Runner Cost**: For larger projects, GitHub-hosted runners may incur additional costs compared to self-hosted solutions.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Jenkins**:
   - Rejected due to higher setup and maintenance overhead compared to GitHub Actions.
2. **GitLab CI/CD**:
   - Rejected because the project is hosted on GitHub, making GitHub Actions more convenient and natively integrated.
3. **CircleCI**:
   - Rejected due to its separate hosting and the lack of built-in integration with GitHub’s ecosystem.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Workflow Setup**: Create YAML workflows for:
   - **Continuous Integration**: Automate build and test processes triggered on pushes and pull requests.
   - **Continuous Deployment**: Automate deployments to staging and production environments.
2. **Secrets Management**: Configure GitHub Secrets to securely store credentials for Docker, Kubernetes, and other integrations.
3. **Reusable Workflows**: Define reusable workflows for common tasks (e.g., running tests, building Docker images) to streamline pipeline updates.
4. **Monitoring and Reporting**: Enable detailed logs and notifications for CI/CD runs to provide actionable feedback to developers.

### Example Workflow

A sample CI workflow might look like this:

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up JDK 17
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          java-version: 17

      - name: Build and Test with Maven
        run: mvn clean verify
```

## Conclusion

GitHub Actions offers a tightly integrated, flexible, and scalable CI/CD solution tailored to the project’s needs. Its ecosystem, ease of use, and cost-effectiveness make it an ideal choice for automating builds, tests, and deployments, enabling a streamlined development workflow and faster delivery of high-quality software.
