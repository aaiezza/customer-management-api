# 10. Decision to Use Conventional Commits for Commit Messages

## Status

**Accepted**

## Context

Consistent and descriptive commit messages are critical for understanding the history of a project, collaborating effectively, and automating tasks like changelog generation. The Conventional Commits standard provides a structured format for commit messages, making it easier to:

1. Understand the scope and intent of changes at a glance.
2. Generate changelogs and release notes automatically.
3. Facilitate better code reviews by providing context for changes.
4. Maintain a clean and professional repository history.

## Decision

The project will adopt the **Conventional Commits** specification for commit messages. This decision ensures that commit messages follow a standardized format, enabling clear communication and integration with tools that leverage this structure.

### Conventional Commit Format

Each commit message will include the following elements:

1. **Type** (required): Describes the category of change (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`).
2. **Scope** (optional): Provides additional context about the part of the codebase affected.
3. **Subject** (required): A short description of the change.
4. **Body** (optional): A more detailed explanation of the change.
5. **Footer** (optional): Additional information, such as breaking changes or issue references.

Example:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

#### Example Commit Messages

- `feat(customer): add support for customer profiles`
- `fix(api): resolve null pointer exception on POST /customers`
- `docs(readme): update installation instructions`
- `refactor(database): optimize query for fetching customer data`
- `chore: update dependencies`
- `improve(ui): enhance customer search interface usability`

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Improved Clarity**: Commit messages provide clear context for changes.
- **Automation**: Tools like `commitlint` and `semantic-release` can automate changelog generation and versioning.
- **Standardization**: Ensures all contributors follow the same format, improving consistency.
- **Collaboration**: Makes it easier for reviewers to understand the intent of changes.

### Drawbacks

- **Learning Curve**: New contributors may need to familiarize themselves with the Conventional Commits standard.
- **Enforcement**: Requires additional tooling or processes (e.g., pre-commit hooks or CI checks) to ensure adherence.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Freeform Commit Messages**:
    - Rejected because they lack structure and consistency, making it harder to understand changes or automate tasks.

2. **Custom Commit Guidelines**:
    - Rejected because Conventional Commits is a widely adopted standard with toolchain support, reducing the need to create and enforce a custom solution.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Documentation**:
    - Add Conventional Commits guidelines to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
    - Provide examples and a quick reference for contributors.

2. **Tooling**:
    - Integrate `commitlint` into the CI pipeline to validate commit messages.
    - Optionally use `husky` to enforce the standard locally with pre-commit hooks.

3. **Onboarding**:
    - Share the Conventional Commits guide with the team and encourage adherence during code reviews.

## Conclusion

Adopting Conventional Commits ensures that commit messages are clear, consistent, and actionable. This practice enhances the projectâ€™s maintainability, facilitates automation, and improves collaboration. The benefits of this decision outweigh the minor effort required to implement and enforce the standard.
