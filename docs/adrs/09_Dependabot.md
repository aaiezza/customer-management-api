# Decision to Use Dependabot for Dependency Management

## Status

**Accepted**

## Context

The project relies on a variety of dependencies, including third-party libraries, frameworks, and tools. Keeping these dependencies up to date is critical for:
- **Security**: Ensuring that known vulnerabilities in dependencies are patched promptly.
- **Stability**: Taking advantage of bug fixes and improvements in new versions of dependencies.
- **Maintainability**: Reducing the technical debt associated with outdated dependencies.

Manually monitoring and updating dependencies can be time-consuming and error-prone. A solution is needed to automate the process while integrating seamlessly with the project’s existing tools and workflows.

Dependabot, a GitHub-native tool for automated dependency management, was chosen to address these needs.

## Decision

The project will use **Dependabot** to automate the process of monitoring and updating dependencies.

### Key Features of Dependabot

- **Automated Updates**: Dependabot automatically creates pull requests (PRs) to update dependencies when new versions are available.
- **Vulnerability Alerts**: Dependabot integrates with GitHub’s security features to identify and patch vulnerabilities in dependencies.
- **Customizable Configuration**: Allows fine-tuned control over update schedules, version constraints, and which dependencies to monitor.
- **GitHub Integration**: Seamless integration with the project’s GitHub repository, including automated PR creation and changelog links for updated dependencies.

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Improved Security**: Dependabot ensures that dependencies are promptly updated to patch vulnerabilities, reducing the project’s security risks.
- **Reduced Maintenance Overhead**: Automating dependency updates saves developers time and effort compared to manual updates.
- **Better Stability**: Regular updates ensure that the project benefits from the latest bug fixes and improvements in dependencies.
- **Auditability**: Dependabot’s automated PRs provide a clear history of dependency updates, enhancing transparency.
- **Flexibility**: Customizable configuration allows the team to control update frequency and target specific dependencies or ecosystems.

### Drawbacks

- **Increased PR Volume**: Dependabot can generate a large number of PRs for frequent updates, which may require additional review time.
- **Breaking Changes**: Updates to major versions may introduce breaking changes, requiring additional testing and review effort.
- **Limited Ecosystem Support**: Dependabot primarily supports widely used ecosystems (e.g., Maven, npm, Docker); less common tools may require alternative solutions.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Manual Updates**:
    - Rejected due to the time and effort required to monitor and update dependencies manually.
2. **Custom Scripts**:
    - Rejected because Dependabot provides a more robust and GitHub-integrated solution out of the box.
3. **Renovate Bot**:
    - Considered for its advanced configuration options but ultimately rejected in favor of Dependabot’s tighter integration with GitHub.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Enable Dependabot**: Configure Dependabot for the project repository via the `.github/dependabot.yml` file.
2. **Configure Update Policies**:
    - Define target ecosystems (e.g., Maven, npm, Docker).
    - Set update frequency (e.g., daily, weekly).
    - Specify allowed version ranges (e.g., only patch and minor updates).
3. **Automate PR Reviews**:
    - Use GitHub Actions to run automated tests on Dependabot PRs.
    - Require manual review for major version updates to mitigate the risk of breaking changes.
4. **Monitor and Adjust**: Review Dependabot’s performance and fine-tune configurations as needed to balance update frequency and review workload.

### Example Configuration

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "maven"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "daily"
  - package-ecosystem: "docker"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
```

## Conclusion

Dependabot provides an automated, secure, and reliable solution for managing dependencies in the project. Its seamless integration with GitHub and robust feature set align with the project’s goals of maintainability, security, and efficiency. The team will adopt Dependabot to streamline dependency management, reducing technical debt and enhancing the project’s overall stability.
